# Deepfake Detection Using Hybrid CNN-RNN (LSTM) Model
 A deep learning project utilizing a CNN-LSTM model to detect deepfake content with high accuracy. The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook for model implementation and training, along with a responsive website built using HTML/CSS to showcase the results and provide an interactive interface.
 
## üìñ Introduction
Deepfake technology has rapidly advanced, enabling hyper-realistic video fabrications that pose significant risks to personal, financial, and societal security.  

This project tackles the deepfake detection challenge by developing a hybrid deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with LSTM units for temporal sequence analysis.

The solution is deployed through a web-based application, allowing users to easily upload videos and determine authenticity with an achieved detection accuracy of **51%** on real-world benchmark datasets.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Overview
- **Problem Addressed:** Detection of manipulated videos (deepfakes) by analyzing both frame-level artifacts and temporal inconsistencies.
- **Solution Developed:** A hybrid CNN-LSTM model trained on a curated dataset and integrated into a lightweight web application using Flask.
- **Real-world Impact:** Equips users, organizations, and digital platforms with a tool to validate video authenticity and combat digital misinformation.

## üéØ Key Features
- Deep learning hybrid architecture: Spatial + Temporal video analysis
- Detection based on facial manipulation inconsistencies
- Dataset diversity: Trained on FaceForensics++, DFDC; tested on Celeb-DF (v2)
- Offline video upload and analysis through a custom-built web interface
- Model designed with computational efficiency for deployment in resource-limited environments
