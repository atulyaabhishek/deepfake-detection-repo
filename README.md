## 📜 Abstract

The rapid evolution of deepfake technology poses significant threats to media integrity and public trust.  
This project presents a hybrid deep learning solution combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spatial feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with LSTM units for temporal analysis.  

A user-friendly web application built with Flask enables users to upload videos and detect deepfakes with an achieved accuracy of **51%** using benchmark datasets.
