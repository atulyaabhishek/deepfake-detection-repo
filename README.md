## 📜 Abstract

The exponential growth of deepfake-based fraud demands robust detection mechanisms. This project presents a hybrid deep learning system that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal inconsistency analysis. 

A web-based application allows users to upload short video clips and classify them as Real or Fake. The model achieves 51% detection accuracy on benchmark datasets even with limited computational resources.
