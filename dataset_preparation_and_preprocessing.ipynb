    "This notebook demonstrates the development of a deepfake detection system using multiple pre-trained **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** models (**ResNet**, **EfficientNet** and **Xception**) combined with **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** for temporal analysis. The dataset used is **FaceForensics++**, **DFDC** and **Celeb-DF (v2)** with `OpenCV` utilized for video frame extraction and preprocessing and `dlib` employed for face detection and cropping."
